K.O.R.E.

Kat Orchestration Runtime Engine

K.O.R.E. is an open-source ecosystem that combines embedded firmware and cross-platform desktop/mobile applications into a single intelligent companion experience.

Overview

K.O.R.E. consists of two main projects:

* KORE_OS — Firmware running on an ESP32-S3 device.
* COMPANION — Cross-platform applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android.

The goal is to provide a seamless interaction between hardware and software through a modular, maintainable and scalable architecture.

## Technology Stack

Firmware

* ESP32-S3
* Arduino Framework

Companion Applications

* React
* Tauri
* Swift (platform-specific integrations)

⸻

## Development Philosophy

K.O.R.E. follows a Specification Driven Development (SDD) workflow.

Every feature begins with a specification before implementation.

Development is performed incrementally, module by module, ensuring that each module is validated before the next one begins.

Core principles:

* Clean architecture
* Modular design
* Incremental development
* High maintainability
* Documentation-first
* Test-driven validation

## AI-Assisted Development

K.O.R.E. adopts specialized AI agents with clearly defined responsibilities. The names from the three Gurus on Chrono Trigger.

Gaspar
Just as Gaspar guides the heroes in Chrono Trigger, this agent guides the documentation, specs, and harness.

Software architect.

Responsible for:

* Architecture
* Specifications
* Technical reviews
* Architectural consistency

Belthazar

Primary implementation agent.
Just as Guru Belthazar created the Epoch in Chrono Trigger, this agent is responsible for building, evolving, and maintaining the project's entire codebase.

Powered by:

* OpenCode
* DeepSeek V4 Flash Free

Responsible for:

* Implementation
* Refactoring
* Testing

Melchior
Just as Melchior forged the Masamune in Chrono Trigger using the Red Rock, this agent is responsible for transforming requirements into elegant, intuitive, and consistent interfaces.

UI/UX specialist.

Powered by:

* Gemini CLI
* UI/UX Pro Max

Responsible for:

* User Interface
* User Experience
* React component design
* Design System

## Documentation

Project documentation is organized as follows:

* PROJECT.md — Project overview and philosophy
* SPEC/ — Functional specifications
* ADR/ — Architecture Decision Records
* HARNESS/ — Implementation tasks
* AGENTS.md — Belthazar implementation guidelines
* GEMINI.md — Melchior UI/UX guidelines

Documentation is the single source of truth.

## Status

🚧 K.O.R.E. is currently under active development. Currently in v1.0.0 for KORE_OS and COMPANION APP (mac os)

The repository is being rebuilt from the ground up using a Specification Driven Development workflow.
